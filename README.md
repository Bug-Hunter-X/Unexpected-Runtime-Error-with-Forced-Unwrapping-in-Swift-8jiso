# Swift Forced Unwrapping Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift programming: unexpected runtime errors due to forced unwrapping of optionals. The `bug.swift` file shows code that crashes when attempting to access the first element of an empty array using forced unwrapping.  The `bugSolution.swift` provides a safe solution using optional binding.
